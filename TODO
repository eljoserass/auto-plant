# shared
- [ ] add shared components, esp-now send and receive + possibly access point
- [ ] validate esp-now functionality

# sensing-pumping

- [ ] write pumping abstractions, start / stop
- [ ] write capacitive soil moisture abstraction at a snesor level
- [ ] join sensor level abstraction into groups of two, each with a digital pin to receive power from, and OK water threshold constant
- [ ] write abstraction to store all sensor readings
- [ ] store timestamp from last reading
- [ ] write function to get all the sensors that current reading is below threshold
- [ ] main watering loop, send postion to water, wait confirmation, start pumping, check sensors, inform pumping finish, send next position (or home)

# robot hose
- validate control of 4 motors through breakout board and external power
- configure positions locations and trajectories ??
- execute trajectories ??
